Tools for desktop support

If I publish a tool here, it's because I think it will make desktop support easier and reduce the possibility of errors for those who are not comfortable with command line. I speak English and PowerShell. Readme.txt files will be published with the scripts. AI is generating, editing and/or reviewing the code.
